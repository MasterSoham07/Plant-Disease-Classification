# Plant Disease Detection

This repository contains code and resources for detecting plant diseases using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for training and evaluating the models has been sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to create an efficient and accurate model that can identify various plant diseases from images.

## Introduction

Plant diseases are a significant threat to agriculture, impacting both the quality and quantity of crop production. Early detection and identification of plant diseases can help mitigate these impacts. This project aims to leverage machine learning to build a model that can accurately classify plant diseases from images.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project has been obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset/data). It contains images of healthy and diseased plants across various species. The dataset is structured as follows:

- `train`: Contains training images.
- `valid`: Contains validation images.
- `test`: Contains testing images.
